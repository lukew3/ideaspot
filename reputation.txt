Ways to use reputation
======================
Set bounty on ideas by using your reputation
* One number of available reputation is shown on your profile and another number shows total reputation
  * Make a field for spent reputation and unspent reputation. Add them when showing total earned
Tip user with reputation
* If you think that a user has come up with good ideas, you can tip them with reputation
  * Could create a loophole where users just upvote each others posts and give each other reputation
    * Or one person with two accounts does this
    * This could happen even without donations
      * One safeguard for this is approving ideas, so users cannot spam lazy ideas and upvote all of them
