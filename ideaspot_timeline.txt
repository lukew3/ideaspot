Move deleted items to trash can
* Set date when they will be removed
  * Check if it should be deleted permanently each time that a user checks their trash can
    * Maybe I could do a daily scrub where I check over all ideas once a day; if the date when they expire has passed, they will be removed
      * Only would have to start that a month from launch because everything expires in 30 days

When requesting many ideas, only transfer the amount of text that would show up on the homepage
* The entire idea doesn't have to be transfered to show it on the home page
* Would be easier to calculate this on pages where the description is shown in one line, like compressed view

Should add a github tag/logo on the front page or nav so that people can go and star it
* Seemed to get a lot of stars on learn-anything.xyz's repo, even though it isn't even really open-source
Clicking outside of idea options menu should close the menu

Could be an inspiration tag
* You post ideas of projects that you have already built
